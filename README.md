# HexSoftwares_Project_Data_Exploration

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Hex Softwares Internship Program** (Data Science Domain). The objective of this project is to perform **Data Exploration** on the **Iris Dataset** to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize data distributions.

This analysis helps in understanding the relationships between different features (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) and how they vary across different species of Iris flowers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and structure analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static plots and graphs.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the classic **Iris Dataset**, which is a staple in the data science community. It includes:
- **150 Samples**
- **4 Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
- **3 Species**: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.

## 📋 Tasks Accomplished
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn.
2. **Data Inspection**: Displayed the first 5 rows, dataset information, and statistical summary (mean, median, std, etc.).
3. **Missing Value Handling**: Checked for null values (the dataset was clean).
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Pairplot**: To visualize pairwise relationships between features.
   - **Boxplots**: To analyze the spread and outliers of features across species.
   - **Histograms**: To check the frequency distribution of Sepal Length.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/saqlain914/HexSoftwares_Project_Data_Exploration)
